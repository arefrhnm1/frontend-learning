# Frontend Learning Notes

This repository documents my learning journey in JavaScript, React, and Next.js
with a focus on **real-world usage, mistakes, and engineering thinking**.

## Goals
- Build strong JavaScript fundamentals
- Understand React and Next.js beyond tutorials
- Document real mistakes and lessons from projects
- Prepare for Junior Frontend / Internship interviews

## Structure
- `javascript/` → Core JavaScript concepts with real examples
- `react/` → React fundamentals and patterns
- `nextjs/` → Next.js (App Router, SSR, data fetching)
- `testing/` → Basic testing concepts (unit tests)
- `mistakes.md` → Bugs and misunderstandings I faced and fixed

## Related Projects
- 🎬 Popcorn Movies (API-driven app)
- 🛍 Veloria E-commerce (UI + Next.js project)

## How I Work
- Each topic has:
  - Questions I had
  - Initial assumptions
  - Correct understanding
  - Wrong vs Correct examples
  - Real project usage
  - Rule of thumb / takeaway
- Mistakes are documented in a separate file for learning from experience
- Commits are atomic and conventional:
  - docs(js): add async-await example
  - docs(react): add useEffect dependency notes


This repo is **not a tutorial copy**.  
It reflects my own understanding, experiments, and lessons learned from real projects.
